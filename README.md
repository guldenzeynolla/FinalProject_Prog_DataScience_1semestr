**Research about Jobs and Salaries in Data Science** ðŸ’¶

My goal is to study the European Union market. Since the master's program in which I am studying is Data Science, it is necessary to know the possibilities of the specialty.

We will work with this database, here link to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data/data).  I used streamlit and python. 

This project includes:

Exploring = 'Exploring the dataset'

Cleaning = 'Data set cleaning'

Plots = 'Interesting plots'

Models = 'Models explaining the data'
